description: Interacting with the Kubernetes API in Backstage plugins
---

[Contributors](https://backstage.io/docs/overview/glossary#backstage-user-profiles) wanting to
create developer portal experiences based on data from Kubernetes (e.g. for
interacting with [Custom
Resources](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/api-extension/custom-resources/)
beyond the default behaviors of the existing Kubernetes plugin) can leverage the
Kubernetes backend plugin's proxy endpoint to allow them to make arbitrary
requests to the [REST
API](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/using-api/api-concepts/).

Here is a snippet fetching namespaces from a cluster configured with the
`google` [auth provider](https://backstage.io/docs/features/kubernetes/configuration#clustersauthprovider):

```typescript
import {
  discoveryApiRef,
  googleAuthApiRef,
  useApi,
} from '@backstage/core-plugin-api';

const CLUSTER_NAME = ''; // use a known cluster name

// get a bearer token from Google
const googleAuthApi = useApi(googleAuthApiRef);
const token = await googleAuthApi.getAccessToken(
  'https://www.googleapis.com/auth/cloud-platform',
);

const discoveryApi = useApi(discoveryApiRef);
const kubernetesBaseUrl = await discoveryApi.getBaseUrl('kubernetes');
const kubernetesProxyEndpoint = `${kubernetesBaseUrl}/proxy`;

// fetch namespaces
await fetch(`${kubernetesProxyEndpoint}/api/v1/namespaces`, {
  method: 'GET',
  headers: {
    'X-Kubernetes-Cluster': CLUSTER_NAME,
    Authorization: `Bearer ${token}`,
  },
});
```

## How it works

The proxy will interpret the
[`X-Kubernetes-Cluster`
header](https://backstage.io/docs/reference/plugin-kubernetes-backend.header_kubernetes_cluster)
as the name of the cluster to target. This name will be compared to each cluster
returned by all the configured [cluster
locators](https://backstage.io/docs/features/kubernetes/configuration#clusterlocatormethods)
-- the first cluster whose [`name` field](https://backstage.io/docs/features/kubernetes/configuration#clustersname) matches
the value in the header will be targeted.

Then the request will be forwarded verbatim (but with the endpoint's base URL
prefix stripped) to the cluster.

## Authentication

Until some security and permission decisions are made (see [this
conversation](https://github.com/backstage/backstage/pull/13026/files#r1029376939)
for context), contributors consuming the proxy endpoint in their plugin code are
responsible for negotiating their own bearer token out-of-band. This requires
knowing some auth details about the cluster being contacted -- in practice, only
clusters with [client side auth
providers](https://backstage.io/docs/features/kubernetes/authentication#client-side-providers) can reasonably be reached.

The proxy has no provisions for mTLS, so it cannot be used to connect to
clusters using the [x509 Client
Certs](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/authentication/#x509-client-certs)
authentication strategy. [Bearer
tokens](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/authentication/#putting-a-bearer-token-in-a-request)
will be forwarded as-is.

## Other known limitations

The proxy as it was released in [Backstage
1.9](https://github.com/backstage/backstage/blob/master/docs/releases/v1.9.0-changelog.md#patch-changes-15)
has a known bug:

- [#15901](https://github.com/backstage/backstage/issues/15901) - it cannot
  reliably target clusters who share the same name with another located cluster.
