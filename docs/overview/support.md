### Adding a recording to the meetup page

To add a new recording to the [meetup page](https://backstage.io/on-demand)
create a file in
[`microsite/data/on-demand`](https://github.com/backstage/backstage/tree/master/microsite/data/on-demand)
with your recording's information. Filenames should be in the format `yyyymmdd-xx.yaml`. The page will sort using the filename. Example file content:

```yaml
---
title: # name of the meetup
date: February 23, 2022 # date, format: Month day, year.
category: Meetup # Can be Event, Meetup, Webinar
description: # description, summary

```

### Adding an upcoming meetup to the meetup page

create a file in
[`microsite/data/on-demand`](https://github.com/backstage/backstage/tree/master/microsite/data/on-demand)
with your meetup's information. Filenames should be in the format `yyyymmdd-xx.yaml`, the page will sort using the filename. Example file content:

```yaml
---
title: # name of the meetup
